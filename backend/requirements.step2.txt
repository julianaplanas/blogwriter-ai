# Step-by-step requirements to avoid Rust dependencies
# Start with working base from requirements.test.txt

# Core (known to work)
fastapi==0.68.0
uvicorn==0.15.0
requests

# Add our needed packages one by one
python-dotenv==1.0.0

# Database - use built-in sqlite3 instead of aiosqlite
# We'll modify the code to use sqlite3 instead

# Skip groq for now - it requires modern pydantic which needs Rust
# We'll add it back once the basic app is working
